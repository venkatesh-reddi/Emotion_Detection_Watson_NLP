# AI-Based Web Application Development and Deployment

In this project, I developed an AI-based web app for an e-commerce company to perform analytics on customer feedback for their signature products. The app is an Emotion Detection system that processes customer feedback in text format and identifies the associated emotions expressed.

## Features

- Analyze customer feedback and detect emotions such as joy, sadness, and anger
- User-friendly output formatting
- Error handling for robustness
- Unit testing to ensure functionality
- Static code analysis for code quality

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework
- **Watson NLP**: IBM's Natural Language Processing library for emotion detection
- **Unit Testing**: Implemented using Python's `unittest` framework
- **Static Code Analysis**: Tools like `pylint` used to ensure code quality

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-detection-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd emotion-detection-app
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Start the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

2. The application will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Provide customer feedback in text format to analyze and detect the associated emotions.
